              <h2>WEEK 2</h2>
              <p class="profText">FourLoops have concluded their week of Test Driven Development. We sadly had to split into two pairs for the project, Owen worked with Francesco and I paired with Tom. The project was to create a stopwatch using TDD.</p>
              <p class="profText">Using QUnit, we employed a paired programming ping pong approach for developing our Stopwatches and after struggling with the asynchronous tests, we achieved two lovely fully functional stopwatches.</p>
              <p class="profText">Check them out here and here</p>
